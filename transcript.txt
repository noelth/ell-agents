[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   The Life of Benjamin Franklin by Samuel G. Goodridge.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   At this time, when the general complaint is that, money is a scarce.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   It should be an act of kindness to inform the money less how they make rainforest their pockets.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   How we will point in, with the true secret of money catching, the certain way to fill empty purses,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   and how to keep them always full.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Two simple rules were observed, we'll do the business.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   First, let honesty and industry be thy constant companions.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   And secondly, spend one pen in less than thy clear gains.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Then shall thy high bound pockets soon begin to thrive, and we'll never again cry with empty belly ache,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   neither will creditors and salty nor will oppress nor hunger bite nor make the nest freeze be.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   The whole hemisphere will shine brighter and pleasure spring up in every corner of thy heart.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Now, therefore embrace these rules and be happy.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Banish the bleak wings of sorrow from thy mind and live independent.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Then shall thou be a man in thy high thy face at the approach of the rich, nor suffer the pain of filling later when the sons of fortune walk at thy right hand.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   For in dependency, whether with a later or much, is good fortune in place deep or even round with the proudest of the golden place.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Oh, then be wise, and let industry walk with thee in the morning and attend thee until thou reaches the even hour for rest.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Let honesty be as the breath of thy soul, and never get to have a penny when all thy expenses are enumerated and paid.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Then shall thou reach the point of happiness?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And in the pannins shall be thy shield and buckler, thy helmet and crown, then shall thy soul walk upright, nor stoop to the silken wedge because the hat reaches, nor pocket and abuse because the hand which offers it wears a hang set with the diamonds.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And of chapter 25.
